<br>

### USB MIDI Device list:

* Required:
    * SPIKE Prime hub
    * Pico Breadboard setup (with two MIDI cables)
* Choose one to run code & output the musical sounds:
    * Mac (running MacOS, with GarageBand)
    * PC (running Windows, with MIDIBerry and loopMIDI)


### BLE MIDI Device list:

    * Mac (running MacOS)

_BLE Example:_ If you have a Mac computer, you only need the hub and your computer, since you can run the code AND GarageBand on your Mac

_BLE Example:_ If you have a Windows computer, for the time being, you will need the hub, your PC, and an iPad (to run GarageBand)
